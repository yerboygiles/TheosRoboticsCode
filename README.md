# TheosRoboticsCode
Code for Hood River Valley Robotics (robotics 1 specifically?)

Instructions for driver control use:
When initialized, press either 'A' or 'B' for POV or tank drive mode, respectively. If you do not press a button, it will automatically choose POV driving.
In POV driving, the triggers are for gas/reverse, and the left stick X-axis is for turning. The faster you are moving forwards, the faster you will turn. It is meant to recreate driving a car as most realistically as possible.
In Tank driving, the Y-axis on the left and right joystick are set to the power of the left and right motors, respectively.
